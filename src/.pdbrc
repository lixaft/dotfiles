# type: ignore
# Python Debugger configuration file.
#
# Description:
#
#   The module pdb defines an interactive source code debugger for Python
#   programs. It supports setting (conditional) breakpoints and single stepping
#   at the source line level, inspection of stack frames, source code listing,
#   and evaluation of arbitrary Python code in the context of any stack frame.
#
#   If a file .pdbrc exists in the userâ€™s home directory or in the current
#   directory, it is read in and executed as if it had been typed at the
#   debugger prompt. This is particularly useful for aliases.
#
# Location:
#
#   ~/.pdbrc
#
